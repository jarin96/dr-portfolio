            <h3>Become a Neurosurgeon</h3>
            <p>If I am able to become a Neurosurgeon, my biggest goal would be to surround myself with other
                professionals in the medical field in order to provide the best care for parents. I also hope to be able
                to make a significant impact on people’s lives by being able to help them to recover or reduce the
                effect of extremely damaging neurological illnesses. The nervous system is quite possibly the most
                mysterious part of the human body. People have been told that they’d never be able to regain feeling
                passed a certain point in their body because of nerve damage. However, through intense therapy,
                determination, and a healthy level of optimism, people have been able to experience amazing recoveries
                after experiencing trauma. I hope that I will be able to help to encourage people to promote their own
                recovery. Even beyond that, people who are able to overcome extreme levels of difficulty are
                inspirational, and I think it would be amazing to be able to be able to experience that inspiration even
                from the sidelines.
                Beyond being able to help people, I hope that my career will never become mentally boring for me. I hope
                that, by pursuing a difficult career, I will be able to receive mental stimulation throughout my life
                that will prevent my brain from stagnating. I think that working as a Neurosurgeon would give me the
                ability to stretch myself while being under constant challenge</p>
